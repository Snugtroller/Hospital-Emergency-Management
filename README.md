# Hospital-Emergency-Management
The code addresses the problem of incident management, specifically the management of emergency and non-emergency incidents. In various real-world scenarios, such as medical facilities, service centers, or administrative offices, there is often a need to manage incoming incidents or requests effectively. These incidents can vary in urgency, with some requiring immediate attention (emergency) and others being less time-sensitive (non-emergency).
